# Hi there, I'm Bitbi Core 👋

Bitbi Core is an open-source project that bases on bitcoin and aims to be more decentralized and secure than bitcoin.

Bitbi Core try to achieve the following goals:

1. let any one can run a full node on their own computer or even their own mobile devices.
2. let any one can mine on their own computer or even their own mobile devices.
3. let any one can chat with others in a decentralized way and without any traces.
4. let any one can store and retrieve their files in a decentralized way and without any traces.
5. more to be continued...

we are working hard to achieve these goals by the following steps:

- [x] A POW algorithm that can be mined and in favor to be mined on a normal computer or even a mobile device;
- :hammer_and_wrench: An all-in-one wallet supporting windows and linux;
- :hammer_and_wrench: Atomic swap;
- [ ] A decentralized chat system;
- [ ] A decentralized file storage system;
